    <!-- About Content -->
    <div class="about-content fade-in">
        <p><strong>We believe good design is invisible.</strong> The best interfaces don't announce themselves—they guide users naturally, anticipate their needs, and get out of the way when the work is done. This philosophy drives every <a href="projects.html" style="color: var(--accent); text-decoration: none;">project we build</a>, from mobile apps to enterprise SaaS platforms.</p>

        <p>Our approach combines visual design with technical implementation. We don't just create mockups and hand them off—we build them, refine them in code, and ensure every interaction feels intentional. This means thinking about performance, accessibility, and edge cases from the start, not as afterthoughts.</p>

        <p><strong>Every project should solve a real problem.</strong> We're drawn to work that simplifies complexity, whether that's streamlining a workflow, making data more understandable, or removing unnecessary friction from everyday tasks. Our <a href="index.html#services" style="color: var(--accent); text-decoration: none;">services</a> are built around this principle.</p>

        <p>We work primarily with modern web technologies and native mobile frameworks—React, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, and carefully chosen tools that prioritize developer experience and end-user performance. But the tools are secondary to the outcome. What matters is creating something that feels cohesive, performs well, and respects the user's time and attention.</p>

        <p>When we're not designing or coding, we're studying what makes interfaces feel natural—whether that's in apps, games, or physical products. The best ideas often come from unexpected places. Want to <a href="contact.html" style="color: var(--accent); text-decoration: none;">work with us</a>? We're always looking for interesting challenges.</p>
